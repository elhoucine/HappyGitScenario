# HappyGitScenario
A git scenarios to start using git quickly.

### Why ?
While working on a new project -sometimes- I meet people who are using git for the first time, and because they need to be running up quickly they end up having hard time understand how to do things without running into trouble.

So I believe scenarios like thses will likely get you running using git in safe and quick manner. But that's not intended to replace any learning ressources on the internet, it is just to get you starting happilly quickly!

## Happy Git:
- [ ] Jumping to a new project hosted in github or bitbucket.
- [ ] Creating a project locally.
