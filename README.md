# HappyGitScenario
A git scenarios to start using git quickly.

### Why ?
While working on a new project -sometimes- I meet people who are using git for the first time, and because they need to be running up quickly they end up having hard time understand how to do things without running into trouble.

So I believe scenarios like thses will likely get you running using git in safe and quick manner. But that's not intended to replace any learning ressources on the internet, it is just to get you starting happilly quickly!

### Happy Git:
- [ ] Will Jump to a new project hosted in github or bitbucket.
- [ ] Will start a project locally.
- [ ] Need to go back to a previous commit.
- [ ] Want to rename a local branche.
- [ ] Want to remove a local branche.
- [ ] Want to remove a remote branche.
- [ ] Want to follow a RELAXING git workflow.
- [ ] Need to update the last commit message.
- [ ] Need to reset changes.
- [ ] Don't want to tap my account password everytime.
- [ ] Don't want to use Terminal.
- [ ] What if I pushed code to a merged branch ?
- [ ] What if I pushed code to a branch with PR ?
